# Synthetic-Data-For-CNC-Machine
The code generates synthetic log data for a networked production environment with CNC machine ID 003 and a monitoring computer. The function generate_ip_address generates a random IP address. The function generate_port_number generates a random port number based on the machine name. The machine name is determined by the generate_machine_name function. The machine status, comment, and network log are generated by the functions generate_machine_status, generate_machine_comment, and generate_machine_network_log, respectively. The function is_local_ip checks if an IP address is local or not. The function generate_log_entry creates a log entry by combining all the generated data for each machine. The function generate_log_data creates num_entries log entries and stores them in the log_data variable. The log data is then written to a CSV file log_data.csv.
